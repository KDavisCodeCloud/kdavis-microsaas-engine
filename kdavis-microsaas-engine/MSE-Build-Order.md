# Micro SaaS Engine — Build Order
**Project:** `kdavis-microsaas-engine`
**Company:** THD Agentic Systems LLC
**Last updated:** 2026-07-17
**Status:** Factory pipeline complete and tested. No product has been run through it end-to-end yet — that is the critical path to launch, not further building.

## What This Is

A research-validated, retention-first software factory producing 1–2 micro-SaaS products per month across 6 research verticals (Healthcare/Medical Front Desk, Legal/Professional Services, E-commerce/Retail Ops, Real Estate/Property Management, HR/Ops/People Management, Finance/Accounting/Bookkeeping). Primary purpose right now: generate low-ticket subscription revenue ($29–$79/mo) fast enough to cover the operating stack before Cloud Decoded closes its first B2B deal. Every product MSE ships has a hard $4K MRR floor enforced at the DB constraint level and 6 retention loops shipping before any feature work.

**Self-funding milestone:** 6 MSE clients at blended pricing covers the full operating stack.

## Completed — Do Not Redo

**Core infrastructure**
- FastAPI backend, JWT auth via `get_supabase_for_request(jwt)`, RLS on every table
- Next.js 15 dashboard — Overview, Research Swarm, Opportunities (renamed from "Pipeline" 2026-07-17), Outreach, Agents, Retention
- n8n self-hosted, workflows active
- Legal docs (EULA, privacy policy, DPA template)
- Test harness — `tests/conftest.py` fake-Supabase fixtures, 94 tests passing

**Research → Verdict pipeline**
- Orchestrator + aggregator agents (LangGraph), 7 quality gates, $4K MRR floor enforced at DB + gate level
- All 6 vertical intel agents built (`agents/{healthcare,legal,ecommerce,realestate,hr-ops,finance}-intel/`) — confirmed producing real opportunities in a live swarm run
- `opportunity_pipeline` table — full status flow

**Build/deploy pipeline (`agents/factory/`)**
- `scaffold_generator.py` → `provision_supabase.py` → `provision_stripe.py` → `deploy.py` → `build_pipeline.py`
- HITL-gated via admin-only `POST /factory/build/{opportunity_id}` — requires a named human (`triggered_by`), never fires automatically
- Deploys to Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend), `thdstack.com` wildcard subdomains

**Outreach**
- Apollo.io lead sourcing (live API key) + Systeme.io (live API key)
- LinkedIn outreach is manual-DM-only by design — no auto-send, HITL queue routes every cold DM to a human
- Bold amber HITL disclaimer + "MANUAL SEND" badge on every LinkedIn lead row in `/outreach` — deployed live 2026-07-17

**Factory Expansion (shipped 2026-07-17)**
- `industry_color_map`, `mse_build_briefs`, `mse_monitoring_events` tables + activation functions — migrations `20260717000011`/`000012`, live and verified
- `agents/factory/brief_generator.py` — auto-generates both build briefs on Verdict PASS, HITL-gated via `POST /factory/generate-brief/{opportunity_id}`, 13 tests passing
- MSE dashboard Opportunities page — new "Build Briefs" section, click-to-expand brief viewer
- `docs/monitoring-agent-suite.md` + `docs/customer-docs-sop-template.md` — reference templates for later use
- CLAUDE.md — search-visibility, brief-generation, and monitoring-activation rules added

## Active — What's Actually Left to Go Live

### 1. Run the first opportunity through the entire pipeline, by hand (CRITICAL PATH)
Nothing has gone through research → Verdict → brief → human approval → build → deploy end-to-end yet. Every stage has been built and unit-tested in isolation, but the real integration risk is between stages, not within them. This is the single highest-priority remaining item — it will surface whatever gap the isolated testing couldn't catch.

**Manual (Kelvin):** pick the opportunity from the Opportunities tab to greenlight; review its generated build brief; approve the build trigger with a Stripe key once ready.
**Once that opportunity clears Verdict:** create the dedicated MSE Stripe account (deferred until now on purpose — no product to attach it to before this).

### 2. Cross-dashboard "agent last ran" correlation
Flagged gap: MSE, CEO, and DecodedSix dashboards don't clearly correlate which agent ran when — DecodedSix's Agents tab was showing "never run" for agents that had in fact run. Needs a real fix, not just DecodedSix-specific — same gap likely exists across all three dashboards since they share the underlying event-emission pattern.

### 3. CEO dashboard cross-repo wiring
The Build Briefs section shipped on the MSE dashboard this session. The equivalent (brief cards + monitoring health cards once a product goes live) still needs to be wired into the CEO dashboard's R&D department view — that's a separate repo (`kdavis-agentic-platform`), not started.

### 4. Monitoring/Incident/Support agent trio — deferred by design, not a gap
Do not build `agents/[slug]_monitor.py` / `_incident.py` / `_support.py` until a real product crosses the $4K MRR / 30-day sustained gate. Full prompts and table templates already exist in `docs/monitoring-agent-suite.md` for when that day comes — building them now would have nothing to run against.

### 5. Follow-on: wire search signals into the research swarm
CLAUDE.md's SEARCH SIGNAL REQUIREMENT FOR VERDICT PASS rule specifies `search_signals`/`objection_signals`/`geo_signals` output fields the vertical agents don't produce yet. Not blocking launch of the first product, but should land before the second or third product ships so Verdict's search-demand gate is real rather than aspirational.

## Key Constraints (Do Not Violate)

- Dedicated Stripe account for MSE — never share with Cloud Decoded or Decoded Holdings, and never create it before a product needs it
- Hard $4K MRR floor enforced at DB constraint level on every product
- 6 retention loops ship before any feature work on any product
- RLS enforced via `get_supabase_for_request(jwt)` in all routes — never service role in API routes
- Every agent emits `POST /events` + an `audit_log` win/lose entry — dashboards depend on this
- Model routing: Haiku for high-volume scraping, Sonnet for analysis — do not swap
- DataSanitizationShield before every LLM call — no exceptions
- No autonomous outbound — every build, brief-generation, or outreach action requires a named human (`triggered_by`) and admin role; this is enforced in code, not just policy
